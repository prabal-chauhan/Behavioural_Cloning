# Behavioural_Cloning

The objective of the Behavioral Cloning Project is to teach a car to drive by itself in a simulator by cloning the actions that you, as a human, execute in order to steer the car. At a very high level, we will use Udacityâ€™s sample data consisting of images and the corresponding steering angles provided in driving_log.csv to train a model to steer the car around the track.
